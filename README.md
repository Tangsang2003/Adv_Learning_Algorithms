# Advanced Learning Algorithms
##### Neural Network using TensorFlow for multi-class classification,  Decision trees and Tree ensemble methods, including Random forests and Boosted trees
This repository contains the lab files from '[Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms)' course from Coursera.\
Also, I have tried to document all the things that I have learned from the lab sessions.\
Week 1 introduced TensorFlow and contained the implementations of simple Neural Networks for determining the quality of the roasted coffee beans.
### Week 1 Lab 2
  - In [Lab 2 of Week 1](/C2_W1_Lab02_CoffeeRoasting_TF.ipynb), from lab_coffee_utils module, load_coffee_data() was used to load the input data.
  - Using Normalization layer from TensorFlow Keras API, the data was normalized along the columns. axis = -1
  - From TensorFlow's Keras API, Dense was used to define layers that represent a fully connected (dense) layer in the neural network. 
  - Training was done for 10 epochs.
  - I didn't understand other codes lol.
